# HydrogenDistributor
Simulate Hydrogen molecules attaching to a sample of MOF-5 over time, with temperature as a variable.
This project was done over August, 2016, while working in Professor Stephen Fitzgerald's lab. The goal was to write a program which could statistically model hydrogen gas molecules sticking to a sample of MOF-5, and examining the effect of temperature and concentrations on the proportion of gas molecules which stuck.
